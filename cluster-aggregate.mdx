It is often important to identify the characteristics of each cluster. One of the best ways to do this is through an aggregation query that summarises different fields within the cluster.

Python (SDK)

`from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_API_KEY)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

vector_fields = ["word_vector_"]
cluster_ops = ds.cluster(vector_fields=vector_fields)

groupby = [
  {"name": "location", "field": "location", "agg": "text"}
]
metrics = [
  {"name": "avg_price", "field": "price", "agg": "avg"},
  {"name": "max_price", "field": "price", "agg": "max"},        
]

result = cluster_ops.aggregate(
    groupby=groupby,
    metrics = metrics
)
`
