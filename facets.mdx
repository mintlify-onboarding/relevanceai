To construct create guides for filters you'll need facets, an overview of a field. Below is a table of what is outputted by facets for different field types.

| **Type** | **What it does**                                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text     | Gets all the different text frequencies                                                     |
| Numeric  | Gets the min, max, sum and average.                                                         |
| Date     | Gets all the different frequencies across either hourly, daily, monthly, yearly can be set. |
| Boolean  | Gets the frequency of both true and false.                                                  |

Grab facets for all available fields:

Python

`from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

ds.facets()
`

You can specify which fields to get facets from and paginate it.

Python

`ds.facets(["brand"], page=1, page_size=10)
`

You can change how date `facets` are handled. Available intervals are `hourly`, `daily`, `monthly`, `yearly`.

Python

`ds.facets(["insert_date_"], date_interval="hourly")
`

To customize your facets further, go to the next section [Aggregations](/docs/aggregations).
