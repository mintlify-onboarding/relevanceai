## The AI platform for all your LLM needs.

Relevance AI is a platform to helps you develop and deploy AI chains fast, securely and reliably:

- ðŸ”— Chaining Notebooks, the best developer experience for building and managing LLM chains. With core capabilities: scheduling, templating, versioning, auto-complete and more.
- ðŸ§© Multiple LLMs, support multiple different LLM models such as GPT4 from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, Cohere, StableLM from Stability and more.
- ðŸ§¾ Unstructured Data Transformations, managed pre-trained machine learning models to quickly analyze unstructured data such as PDFs, Audio and more with LLMs.
- ðŸ’¾ Datasets, managed multi-purpose datasets to save your chain results for training your own LLM or ingest data into datasets for analysis with chains.
- ðŸ”‘ Vector Database, datasets have vector database capabilities for creating, storing and querying vectors with flexible vector similarity search, that can be combined with multiple vectors, aggregates, filters and many other retrieval methods.


Alternatively, connect with any of your existing databases, vector databases, transformations with our integrations and custom transformations.

### Collaborate and deploy fast.
- ðŸš€ Launch chains as an API instantly.
- âœ¨ Share chains as embeddable apps with your team.
- ðŸ”Ž Search dashboard with filters and vector similarity search to explore your data more easily.
