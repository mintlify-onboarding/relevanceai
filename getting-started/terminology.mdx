| **Terminology**             | **Definition**                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vectors                     | AKA embeddings, 1D arrays, latent space vectors.                                                          |
| Vectorizers/models/Encoders | Turns data into vectors (e.g. Word2Vec turns words into vectors).                                         |
| Vector Similarity Search    | Nearest neighbor search, distance search.                                                                 |
| Dataset                     | Index, Table (a dataset is made up of multiple documents)                                                 |
| Documents                   | (AKA JSON, item, dictionary, data row) - a document can contain vectors and other important information . |
| Field                       | A field is a key in a Python dictionary `key : 0.123`.                                                    |
| Value                       | A value is a value in a Python dictionary `description : value`.                                          |
| Insert                      | (AKA index a dataset) is the process of inserting a dataset to Relevance AI platform.                     |
