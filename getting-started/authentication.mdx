To interact with Relevance, you'll need an API Key. Once you've signed up your API key can be found in [https://cloud.relevance.ai/sdk/api/](https://cloud.relevance.ai/sdk/api/).

Each API key is assigned to a region and project. Pick the region that is closest to you for the lowest latency.

Interactive authentication, you will be prompted to provide your api key:

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client()
#You will be prompted to enter your API Key
```

Alternatively to authenticate without prompt:


```python Python
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
```
