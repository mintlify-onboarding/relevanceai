Report app can be editted via the dashboard without any coding, we provide great helper functions to make sure your app is constantly synced throughout.

### Syncing via reloading the app

When you reload the app with a deployable id all the latest changes will be reloaded as well.

```python Python
from relevanceai.apps import ReportApp
app = ReportApp(name="My App", dataset=ds, deployable_id="12345")
```

### Syncing via refreshing the app

If your app was editted via dashboard or another collaborate, whilst your app class was already created. You can run `app.refresh` to update your local app class with all the changes they have made.

```python Python
app.refresh()
```

This function will return all the updates that were made by your collaborators as well.

## Resetting your app

You can reset your app to a blank app with `app.reset` this is especially useful if you are creating your app within a python script as opposed to a python notebook.

```python Python
from relevanceai.apps import ReportApp
app = ReportApp(name="My App", dataset=ds, deployable_id="12345")
app.reset()
app.h1("My Report App")
app.h2("Where I present insights")
app.deploy()
```

This will ensure that everytime your script is updated with a new block and it is reran all the other blocks aren't appended but recreated with this.
