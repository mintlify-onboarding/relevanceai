## Main concepts

Creating reports are simple. You add a few app sections, blocks and marks and then your run `app.deploy()`

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN)

from relevanceai.apps import ReportApp
app = ReportApp(name="My App", dataset=ds)
app.h1("My first app")
app.p("Creating my first app")
app.deploy()
```

You can also display your app within jupyter notebook with:

```python Python
app.gui()
```

### Blocks

Blocks are essentially content, every time you add a paragraph, image or chart that's a block. There are many different kind of blocks, some blocks can contain other blocks. A page is a combination of different blocks you add to it.

### Marks

Marks are a way to format text blocks, such as bold, italic. You can add multiple marks to a single block. 

### Sections

Sections are a logical combination of blocks that is packaged together for a specific use case. e.g. you can have a combination of a dataframe of a time series and a line chart of that dataframe as a "time series section".

### Deployable ID

Every app is associated with a **deployable** configuration. Every deployable has a unique id. You can access your app's id with `app.deployable_id`. If your id is None, run `app.deploy` and an id will be generated with the app.

You can reload apps by specifying its deployable id:

```python Python
my_id = "123456"
app = ReportApp(name="My App", dataset=ds, deployable_id=my_id)
`

This will reload all the created blocks, marks and sections for the app into your app class.
