Marks are a way to format text blocks, such as bold, italic. You can add multiple marks to a single block.

## Bold

```python Python
app.p(app.bold("This is a bolded text"))
```

## Italic

```python Python
app.p(app.italic("This is an italicised text"))
```       

## Strike

```python Python
app.p(app.strike("This is a striked text"))
```

## Underline

```python Python
app.p(app.underline("This is an underlined text"))
```

## Code

```python Python
app.p(app.inline_code("import numpy as np"))
```

## Combining marks

You can combine marks freely and they'll be applied accordingly.

```python Python
app.p(app.underline(["This is", app.bold("bold"), "and underlined text"]))
```

<Warning>
❗️**A mark must be used with a text block**

Such as `paragraph`, `h1`, etc. Otherwise it will not be added to the app.

</Warning>

```python Python
app.italic("This is an italicised text")
```

This will not add the text to the app.
