## Plotly

Make sure you have plotly installed with `pip install plotly`.  
You can embed any plotly chart simply with `app.plotly`:

```python Python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])
app.plotly(fig, title="My Scatter Plot")
```

By default the chart will be an interactive plotly chart, to turn off the interactivity and embed just as an image. `static=True`. You'll also need `kaleido` installed with `pip install kaleido`.

```python Python
app.plotly(fig, title="My Scatter Plot", static=True)
```
