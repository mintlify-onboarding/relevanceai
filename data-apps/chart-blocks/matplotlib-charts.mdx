## Pyplot

You can embed any matplotlib pyplot chart simply with `app.pyplot`:

```python Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])
app.pyplot(fig, title="My simple line chart")
```

By default the chart will be an interactive altair chart, to turn off the interactivity and embed just as an image. `static=True`. You'll also need `altair_saver` installed with `pip install altair_saver`.

## Seaborn

You can also embed any seaborn chart as well:

```python Python
import seaborn as sns

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
fig = sns.relplot(
    data=tips,
    x="total_bill", y="tip", col="time",
    hue="smoker", style="smoker", size="size",
)
app.pyplot(fig)
```
