## Deleting a dataset

Deleting a dataset will also delete any associated clusters, metadata, S3 files belonging to the dataset as well.

```python Python 
from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
client.delete_dataset("test-data-1")
```

Another way of deleting a dataset

```python Python 
ds = client.Dataset("test-data-2")
ds.delete()
```

## Deleting documents

You can delete documents in your dataset by its ids.

```python Python 
ids_to_delete = ["1", "2", "5"]

ds.delete_documents(ids_to_delete)
```
