### Chunk Documents

Chunks are a list/array of documents/dictionary. They are useful to breakdown a large piece of data into smaller ones. e.g. `sentences` are chunks from `paragraphs`. Chunk documents have `chunks` which are denoted by the suffix `_chunk_`.

An example of a chunk document is as such:

```python Python 
{
  "_id" : 1,
  "title" : "Apple IPhone 13 Pro",
  "title_chunk_" : [
    {"word": "Apple, "word_chunkvector_":[0.12, 0.23, ...]},
    {"word": "IPhone, "word_chunkvector_":[0.23, 0.34, ...]},
    {"word": "13, "word_chunkvector_":[0.34, 0.45, ...]},
    {"word": "Pro, "word_chunkvector_":[0.45, 0.56, ...]}
  ],
  "title_word_vector_" : [0.12, 0.34, ...],
}
```

| Chunks (Beta)      | Chunks are a list/array of documents/dictionary. They are useful to breakdown a large piece of data into smaller ones. e.g. `sentences` are chunks from `paragraphs`. Must have the suffix (ends with) `\_chunk\_`.                 | `"text\_chunk\_":\[0.12, 0.34, ...\]`                        |
| Chunkvector (Beta) | A vector or embedding for chunks. Must have the suffix (ends with) `\_chunkvector\_`, and can only be stored within chunks. It cannot exceed length of 2048, for length greater than 2048 you can break it up into smaller vectors. | `"text\_chunk\_.sentence\_chunkvector\_":\[0.12, 0.34, ...\]`|

Documents containing chunk fields can be used for special chunk related features such as chunk vector search, aggregating on chunk data, etc.
