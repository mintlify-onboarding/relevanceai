## Copy a dataset from another project

With Relevance you can send and recieve dataset from other users. This allows you to freely collaborate and share datasets between accounts.

- `dest_project` and `dest_api_key` refer to your destination project and api\_key or where the copied version of dataset is going to be saved.

```python Python (SDK) 
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)

## Source project details you are copying from
src_dataset_id = "quickstart"

## Source project details you are copying to
dest_project = "new_quickstart"
dest_api_key = DESTIONATION_API_KEY

client.send_dataset(
    src_dataset_id,
    dest_project,
    dest_api_key
)
```

## Clone a dataset

Cloning a dataset will create an exact copy of an existing dataset. Good for backing up data before transformations.

```python Python (SDK) 
copied_dataset_id = COPIED_DATASET_ID
client.clone_dataset(src_dataset_id, copied_dataset_id)
```

Note: For enterpise we do hourly snapshots to help restore data as well.
