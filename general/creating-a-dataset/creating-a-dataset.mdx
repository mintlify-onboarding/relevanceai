## Dataset & Documents

A collection of documents is called a dataset.

Documents can be described as Python dictionaries and is a unit of data in Relevance - similar to a row in a SQL table or a document in MongoDB collection. 

Documents are stored in Relevance AI as a JSON. By storing data in this format you can store complex structures that are common to unstructured data. Example:

```python Python
{
  "_id" : 1,
  "title" : "Apple IPhone 13 Pro",
  "product" : {
    "image_url" : "https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/8756/as-images.apple.com/is/iphone-card-40-iphone13pro-202203?wid=340&hei=264&fmt=p-jpg&qlt=95&.v=1644989935267"
    "price" : 1699
  },
  "title_ner" : [
    {"substring":"Apple", "label":"Organization", "probabilty":0.98}, 
    {"substring":"IPhone", "label":"Product", "probability":0.97}, 
  ],
  "title_labels" : [
    {"label":"Phone", "probability":0.93}, 
    {"label":"Electronic", "probabilty":0.80}, 
  ],
  "words" : ["Apple", "IPhone", "13", "Pro"],
  "title_word_vector_" : [0.12, 0.34, ...],
  "product_image_vector_" : [0.12, 0.34, ...],
}
```

- A document can be **nested** (dictionary of dictionaries) or have **array** (list) values.
- A **field** refers to the key of a dictionary.

| **Schema Rule**                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Example**                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Each document should include an \_id string field that is used to uniquely identify each document, if 2 documents have the same \_id the last inserted document will overwrite the old one.                 | `"\_id": "j2hfio23j"`                  |
| If you are inserting **vectors**. The field must end (suffix) with \_vector\_. All vectors under a field must be the same length. You can store as many different vectors as you want in a single document. | `"word\_vector\_":\[0.12, 0.34, ...\]` |

<Warning>
**Dataset Limitations!**

-  You cannot rename datasets or rename/edit existing field names. However, you can clone datasets and edit field names in the clone using the [`clone`](https://relevanceai.readthedocs.io/en/v0.33.2/client.html#relevanceai.http%5Fclient.Client.clone%5Fdataset) feature.
-  A Dataset name cannot contain spaces or capital letters.
