title: "Parent-Child Relationships"
---

With so much relevant data being extracted, it is important to be able to store the parent-child relationships between input fields and output fields. This allows us to list the relevant fields when analyzing a text field. 

For example:

## Storing Parent Child Relationships

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client 
client = Client()
ds = client.Dataset("sample")
ds.update_field_children(
  field="text_field",
  field_children=["text_sentiment"],
  category="sentiment",
  metadata={"model": "Social Media Model"}
)
```

If you are interested in the API documentation for parent-child relationships, you can find them here 

## Listing Parent Child Relationships

```python Python
# Simple way to list all available field children!
ds.list_field_children()
