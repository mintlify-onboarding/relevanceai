## Retrieving documents by their ids

```python Python 
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

ids_to_retrieve = ["1", "2"]
ds.get(ids_to_retrieve)
```

ids that don't belong in the dataset will just return a document with just the `_id`.

## Retrieve a random sample of documents

```python Python 
ds.get_documents(number_of_documents=20)
```

## Retrieve all documents

```python Python 
ds.get_all_documents()
```

## Retrieve documents options

You can freely adjust how the retrieve documents are returned.

### Selected fields only

For all the above retrieve functions, you can choose which fields to include when retrieving the documents.

```python Python 
ds.get_documents(number_of_documents=20, select_fields=["name", "reviews.rating"])
```

By default we return all the vectors, but you can choose to remove them simply with `include_vector=False`

```python Python 
ds.get_documents(number_of_documents=20, include_vector=False)
```

### Sort documents

You can sort documents by different fields as well `desc` for descending order, `asc` for ascending order.

```python Python 
ds.get_documents(sort=[{"reviews.rating":"desc"}])
```

The sort is multi-level as well, to further sort documents with same values.

```python Python 
ds.get_documents(sort=[{"reviews.rating":"desc"}, {"reviews.numHelpful":"desc"}])
```

### Filter documents

You can retrieve documents that meet your filter criteria. Below is the simple way of doing it.

```python Python 
filters = ds["name"] == "Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta"
ds.get_documents(number_of_documents=20, filters=filters)
```

For the more advanced filtering options:

```python Python 
filters = [
    {
        "field": "name",
        "filter_type": "exact_match",
        "condition": "==",
        "condition_value": "Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta"
    }
]
ds.get_documents(number_of_documents=20, filters=filters)
```
