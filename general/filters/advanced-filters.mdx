The python interface is a quick way that simplifies the way filters are constructured. The following explores how to create a more indepth filter with a lot of customisability.

## How to form a filter?

Filters at Relevance AI are defined as Python dictionaries with four main keys:

- `field` (i.e. the data filed in the document you want to filter on)
- `condition` (i.e. operators such as greater than or equal)
- `filter_type` (i.e. the type of filter you want to apply - whether it be date/numeric/text etc.)
- `condition_value` (dependent on the filter type but decides what value to filter on)

```python Python
filter = [
    {
        "field": "description",
        "filter_type": "contains",
        "condition": "==",
        "condition_value": "Apple"
    }
]
```

### Filtering operators

Relevance AI covers all common operators:

- \"==\" (a == b, a equals b)
- \"!=\" (a != b, a not equals b)
- \">=\" (a >= b, a greater that or equals b)
- \">\" (a > b, a greater than b)
- \"\<\" (a < b, a smaller than b)
- \"\<\= \" (a \<\= b, a smaller than or equals b)

### Filter types

Supported filter types at Relevance AI are listed below.

- contains
- exact\_match
- word\_match
- categories
- exists
- date
- numeric
- ids
- support for mixing together multiple filters such as in OR situations

We will explain each filter type followed by a sample code snippet in the next pages.
