<Note>
**📘 Filters help us find what we need**

Filters are great way to retrieve a subset of documents that matches certain criteria. This allows us to have a more fine-grained overview of the data.  

For instance, in an e-commerce dataset, we can retrieve all products:

- with `prices` between 200 and 300 dollars
- with the phrase `free return` included in `description` field
- that are produced after `January 2020`
</Note>

Filters can be used in many different places such as retrieving documents, search, cluster, transformations, etc.

## Simple filters

For python we provide a simpler interface to filter data that is very similar to pandas.

### Category filter (exact match)

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

filters = ds["title"] == "Apple IPhone 13 Pro"

ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
```

### Numeric filter

```python Python
filters = (ds["price"] >= 200) + (ds["price"] < 300)

ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
```

### Exists filter

```python Python
filters = ds['sold'].exists()

ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
```

or to filter by not exist

```python Python
filters = ds['sold'].not_exists()

ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
```

### Contains substring

To filter by a substring of a text.

```python Python
filters = ds['title'].contains("Apple")

ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
```

### Date filtering

To filter by data matching an exact date.

```python Python
filters = ds["_insert_date"].date("2020-07-01")

ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
```

There are more filters options and ways to customize filters that are explored in the following sections.

The full list of filters we support are: `exists`, `ids`, `numeric`, `date`, `contains`, exact\_match`, word_match`, `categories`, `regex`
