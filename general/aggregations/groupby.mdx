title: "Supported groupbys"
---

Each groupby requires a `name`, `field` and `agg`.

* `field` is the field you are aggregating on.
* `agg` is the type of aggregation you are going to perform.
* `name` is an field to rename the output of the aggregation.

The groupby's we support are `text` (alias:`category`), `numeric`, `wordcloud`, `array`

## `text`

Works on fields with a `text` type. Groups the field by each unique value, like a category.

```python Python
{"name": "location", "field": "propertyDetails.area", "agg": "category"}
```

## Groupby `date` fields

Just add `date_interval` to your `category` aggregate. We support `monthly`, `daily`, `yearly`, `hourly`, `minutely`, `weekly`

```python Python
{"name": "month", "field": "insert_date_", "agg": "category", "date_interval":"monthly"}
```

## `numeric`

Works on fields with a `numeric` type.

```python Python
{"name": "bedrooms", "field": "propertyDetails.bedrooms", "agg": "numeric"}
```

### bucketing `numeric`

You can bucket numeric in 2 ways:  
First one is specifying the range:

```python Python{ "name": "bedrooms", "field": "propertyDetails.bedrooms", "agg": "numeric", 
  "bucket" : [{"from" : 0, "to": 2}, {"from" : 2, "to" 4}, {"from" : 4, "to": 5}] }
```

Second one is specifying the interval and you can set minimum frequency as well:

```python Python
{ "name": "bedrooms", "field": "propertyDetails.bedrooms", "agg": "numeric", 
  "bucket" : {"interval":2, "min_doc_count": 5} }
```

## `array`

Works on fields with a `numeric`, `text` types. Groups the field by each unique array/list. It will ignore the order of the array and will sort all arrays by alphabetical order.

```python Python
{"name": "bedrooms", "field": "propertyDetails.tags", "agg": "array"}
```

## `wordcloud`

Works on fields with a `text` type. Groups the field by each unique word that occurs in the field, great for producing wordclouds. You can also provide it words to remove, via `remove_words=[...]`.

```python Python
{"name": "bedrooms", "field": "propertyDetails.tags", "agg": "wordcloud", 
 "remove_words":["this","that"]}
```
