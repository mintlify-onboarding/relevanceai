## Aggregations

Aggregations are a way to extract analytics insights from data to then be visualized to create reports and charts. In Relevance aggregations can be combined with filters, search, clusters and more!

## Simple aggregation query

Each aggregation requires a `name`, `field` and `agg`. 

* `field` is the field you are aggregating on.
* `agg` is the type of aggregation you are going to perform.
* `name` is an field to rename the output of the aggregation.

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

groupby = [
  {"name": "location", "field": "location", "agg": "text"}
]
metrics = [
  {"name": "avg_price", "field": "price", "agg": "avg"},
  {"name": "max_price", "field": "price", "agg": "max"},        
]

results = ds.aggregate(metrics=metrics, groupby=groupby)
```

Aggregation is pagination supported. You can control the `page_size` and `page`.

```python Python
results = ds.aggregate(metrics=metrics, groupby=groupby, page_size=20, page=2)
```

Aggregations can be sorted as well `desc` for descending order, `asc` for ascending order.

```python Python
results = ds.aggregate(metrics=metrics, groupby=groupby, sort=[{"avg_price" : "desc"}])
```

## Combining filters with aggregations

Aggregations can be used in conjunction with filters.

```python Python
filters = ds['location'] == "New York" 
results = ds.aggregate(metrics=metrics, groupby=groupby, filters=filters)
```
