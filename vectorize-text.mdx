Our default vectorizer is using `all-mpnet-base-v2` from [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/). So we have to install `sentence-transformers` first.

Shell

`pip install -U relevanceai[models]
`

Once installed you can vectorize any text fields. You vectorize multiple fields at once.

Python

`text_fields = ["text"]
ds.vectorize_text(fields=text_fields)
`

The vector fields outputted will be `text_sentence-transformers_all-mpnet-base-v2`. To output it to a different field name use `output_fields=[..]`.

Python

`ds.vectorize_text(fields=["reviews.text"], output_fields=["text_vector_"])
`

### You can also provide any HuggingFace or SentenceTransformers models.

Python

`ds.vectorize_text(
    models=["sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1",
           "princeton-nlp/sup-simcse-roberta-large"],
    fields=text_fields
)
`

The vector fields outputted will be `text_sentence-transformers_all-distilroberta-v1` and `text_princeton-nlp_sup-simcse-roberta-large`.

### Lightning fast server side vectorize with Similarity

You can vectorize with lightning fast Similarity AI's inference server with pretrained models, first signup via [https://similarity.ai](https://similarity.ai).

### Filter and Vectorize

You can also filter the text you want vectorized.

Python

`ds.vectorize_text(fields=text_fields, filters=filters)
`
