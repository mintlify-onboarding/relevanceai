## Hybrid search

Hybrid search, combining text and vector search to create the best results. For example, vector search isn't great at matching SKUs such as "KFR-123", where as traditional search excels at it.

Python

`text_query = "Awesome"
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
    query=text_query,
    fields_to_search=["text"],
)
`

You can adjust the weight of traditional search as well with `query_config.weight`.

Python

`text_query = "Awesome"
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
    query=text_query,
    fields_to_search=["text"],
    query_config={"weight": 0.1}
)
`

## Just traditional search

You can also just search without vectors.

Python

`text_query = "Awesome"
results = ds.search(
    query=text_query,
    fields_to_search=["text"],
)
`
