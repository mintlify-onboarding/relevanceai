Vector Search is reliant largely on index libraries and open-source models. Each vector search guide follows a template of:

The steps/materials can be summarised in the following way:

**Data**: Obtain the data in a way that can be processed into a numerical representation and fed through the necessary model.  
**Encode**: Feed the data's numerical representation into a model and extract the vector which can be indexed and searched.  
**Index**: Indexing the vectors (from which the data has been encoded) in an efficient way that allows for retrieval.  
**Search**: Search the vectors that have been indexed by using a variety of Nearest Neighbor algorithms, filters, chunking and queries.

**The Difficulties of Vector Search**  
While the above process appears simple, there are a lot of difficulties with actually using vector search for production. These difficulties include:

* Deploying your index and search for production
* Usage of vectors to optimise search results
* Optimising the way search is being done on the vectors
* Optimising the matching of user intent and products
