Marks are a way to format text blocks, such as bold, italic. You can add multiple marks to a single block.

## Bold

Python

`app.p(app.bold("This is a bolded text"))
`

## Italic

Python

`app.p(app.italic("This is an italicised text"))
`

## Strike

Python

`app.p(app.strike("This is a striked text"))
`

## Underline

Python

`app.p(app.underline("This is an underlined text"))
`

## Code

Python

`app.p(app.inline_code("import numpy as np"))
`

## Combining marks

You can combine marks freely and they'll be applied accordingly.

Python

`app.p(app.underline(["This is", app.bold("bold"), "and underlined text"]))
`

> ### ❗️
> 
> A mark must be used with a text block
> 
> Such as `paragraph`, `h1`, etc. Otherwise it will not be added to the app.

Python

`app.italic("This is an italicised text")
`

This will not add the text to the app.
