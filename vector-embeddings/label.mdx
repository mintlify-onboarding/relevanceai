You can label data without any training. The labels also can be any length, words or sentences. 

The labels your provide needs to be in a document (list of dictionaries) format. You can also include other information besides the label to assign to your dataset.

```python Python 
from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

labels = [
    {
        "label": "Phone",
        "label_vector_": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1],
        "price_type" : "high"
    },
    {
        "label": "Food",
        "label_vector_": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        "price_type" : "low"
    }
]

ds.label(
    vector_fields=["text_vector_"],
    label_documents=labels,
    output_field="label",
    expanded=True,
)
```

If you just want a list of tags and not extra information, set `expanded=False`

You can change the `max_number_of_labels` and `similarity_threshold` to make sure you get the most appropriate labels.

```python Python 
ds.label(
    vector_fields=["text_vector_"],
    label_documents=labels,
    output_field="label",
    max_number_of_labels=2,
    similarity_threshold=0.2,
    expanded=False
)
```

Just like many functionality in Relevance, you can also combine filters with label.

```python Python 
ds.label(
    vector_fields=["text_vector_"],
    output_field="label",
    label_documents=labels,
    filters=filters
)
```
