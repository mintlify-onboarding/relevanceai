## Use CLIP a multi-modal vectorizer

Our default vectorizer is using `CLIP` from OpenAI. CLIP vectorize image or text into same space. This enables functionalities such as text to image search.  
Lets first install `clip` first.

```shell Shell
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

Once installed you can vectorize any image fields. You vectorize multiple fields at once. Your image fields needs to be a `url` of an image file. If your images are in your local file system, upload those files first with [Inserting files](/docs/python-inserting-files).

```python Python 
image_fields = ["image_url"]
ds.vectorize_image(fields=image_fields)
```

## Use BIT from TFHub

A image model from [Google](https://tfhub.dev/google/bit/m-r50x1/1). Great for reverse image search. 

```python Python 
ds.vectorize_image(fields=["thumbnail"], models=["m-r50x1"])
```

### Filter and Vectorize

You can also filter the images you want vectorized.

```python Python 
ds.vectorize_image(fields=image_fields, filters=filters)
```
