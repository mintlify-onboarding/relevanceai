## Using FeatureExtractor

Say you have trained a resnet model for a classification task and you would like to extract the 2nd last layer/pooling layer to turn your classification model into a vectorizer. You can do so with the `FeatureExtractor`


```python Python 
import torch
import torchtext
import torchvision

from relevanceai.operations_new.processing.feature_extractor import FeatureExtractor

x = torch.randn(10, 3, 224, 224)
model = torchvision.models.resnet34()

fx = FeatureExtractor(model, layer_name="avgpool")

vectors = fx(x) # vectors of samples passed through model exitting from avgpool layer
```

## Using EmbeddingsExtractor

If instead you are working with text/embedding model and would like to extract vectors from the just the embedding layers themselves, then you would use `EmbeddingsExtractor`


```python Python 
from relevanceai.operations_new.processing.feature_extractor import EmbeddingsExtractor

x = torch.tensor([1, 4, 78, 34, 234, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
model = torchtext.models.RobertaModel(torchtext.models.roberta.RobertaEncoderConf())

fx = EmbeddingsExtractor(model)
vectors = fx(x) # vectors associated with tokens in x
```
