Multi-vector search offers a more powerful and more flexible search by combining several vectors across different fields and vectorizers, allowing us to experiment with more combinations of models and configurations.

## Simple multi-vector search

With Relevance you can search with multiple vectors against multiple different fields.

### Searching with multiple vectors from different models

```python Python
search_query = [
    { "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "field": "word_vector_"},
    { "vector": [0.33, 0.44, 0.55, 0.66, 0.77], "field": "image_vector_"}
]
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
)
```

Can also be used to search against multiple different fields that belong to the same vector space.

### Weighted multi-vector search

You can change the weights of different vectors as well.

```python Python
search_query = [
    { "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "field": "word_vector_", "weight": 0.4},
    { "vector": [0.33, 0.44, 0.55, 0.66, 0.77], "field": "image_vector_", "weight":0.6}
]
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
)
```
