## Simple vector search

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

search_query = [
    { "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "field": "word_vector_"}
]
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
)
```

Just like retrieve documents you can select which fields to include with `select_fields=[...]`, or remove vectors from the reponse `include_vector=False`.

```python Python
search_query = [
    { "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "field": "word_vector_"}
]
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
    select_fields=["word"],
    include_vector=False,
)
```

### Combine with filters

```python Python
filters = ds["price"] > 20

results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
        filters=filters,
)
```

### Combine with traditional text search

Combining vector search with traditional text search can often create the best results. For example, vector search isn't great at matching SKUs such as "KFR-123".

```python Python
text_query = "Awesome"
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
    query=text_query,
    fields_to_search=["text"],
)
```

You can also perform a traditional search without vectors

```python Python
text_query = "Awesome"
results = ds.search(
    query=text_query,
    fields_to_search=["text"],
)
```

### Minimum relevance score

You can set a minimum score for results to be shown.

```python Python
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
    minimum_relevance=0.3
)
```

### Sort results

Just like retrieving documents, you can sort the order of the results as well. By default it is by `relevance`.  
`desc` for descending order, `asc` for ascending order.

```python Python
results = ds.search(
    vector_search_query=search_query,
    sort=[{"price":"desc"}]
)
```
