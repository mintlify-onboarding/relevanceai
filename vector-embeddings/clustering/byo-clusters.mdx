description: "How to bring your own cluster labels by turning categories into clusters."

You can turn your categorical fields into cluster fields, for example here we turn the `brand` category into clusters. 

```python Python 
from relevanceai import Client 
client = Client(token=YOUR_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset(dataset_id)

categorical_field = "brand"

vector_fields = ["product_description_vector_"]
alias = "brand_clusters"

ds.byo_cluster(
    vector_fields=vector_fields,
    alias=alias,
    byo_cluster_field=categorical_field,
)
```

By specifying the `vector_fields`, your centroids will be created by taking the average of all the vectors in each `brand` category 

If you have your own centroids, you can provide it instead:

```python Python 
ds.byo_cluster(
    vector_fields=vector_fields,
    alias=alias,
    byo_cluster_field=categorical_field,
    centroids=centroids
)
```
