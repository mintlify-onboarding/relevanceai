It is often important to identify the characteristics of each cluster. One of the best ways to do this is through an aggregation query that summarises different fields within the cluster.

```python Python (SDK)
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_API_KEY)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

vector_fields = ["word_vector_"]
cluster_ops = ds.cluster(vector_fields=vector_fields)

groupby = [
  {"name": "location", "field": "location", "agg": "text"}
]
metrics = [
  {"name": "avg_price", "field": "price", "agg": "avg"},
  {"name": "max_price", "field": "price", "agg": "max"},        
]

result = cluster_ops.aggregate(
    groupby=groupby,
    metrics = metrics
)
```
