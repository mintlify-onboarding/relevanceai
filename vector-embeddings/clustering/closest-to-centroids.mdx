Centroids from your clustering algorithm describe the 'average' of each cluster. Relevance AI allows you to query for a list of documents that are closest to the centroids of each cluster.

```python Python
from relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_API_KEY)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

vector_fields = ["word_vector_"]
cluster_ops = ds.cluster(vector_fields=vector_fields)

cluster_ops.list_closest()
```

You can also list furthest from centroid

```python Python 
cluster_ops.list_furthest()
```
