## Dimensionality Reduction

If you have a single or multiple large vectors. You can reduce your vectors down to `n_components` easily. This is great for ensembling different vectors, but also interpretation by projecting onto a 3D/2D plane.

```python Python 
from relevanceai import Client
client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("quickstart")

vector_fields = ["text_vector"]
ds.reduce_dims(vector_fields=vector_fields, n_components=3)
```

The default model used is PCA from scikit-learn.

This outputs to the "\{alias\}_\{vector\_field\}\_vector_" by default. You can change it easily with `output_field`.

```python Python 
ds.reduce_dims(vector_fields=vector_fields, n_components=3, output_field="pca_vector_")
```

Out of the box support for many other dimensionality reduction algorithms.

## Support for UMAP

[https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

```shell Shell
pip install umap-learn
```

Then you can use `model=umap` with an easy string

```python Python 
dr_model = umap.UMAP()
ds.reduce_dims(vector_fields=vector_fields, n_components=3, 
               model="umap", output_field="pca_vector_")
```

We also support [IVIS](https://bering-ivis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python%5Fpackage.html), TSNE out of the box. Just pass in "tsne", "ivis".

## Combine with filters

Just like many functions in Relevance, dimensionality reduction can be combined with filters.

```python Python 
ds.reduce_dims(vector_fields=vector_fields, n_components=3, 
               output_field="pca_vector_", filters=filters)
```
