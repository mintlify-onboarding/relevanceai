Analyzing text is as simple as a single line of code.

```python Pythonfrom relevanceai import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_ACTIVATION_TOKEN)
ds = client.Dataset("customer_reviews")

text_fields = ["reviews"]
ds.analyze_text(fields=text_fields)
```

This will run a whole range of text analysis models: `vectorize`, `cluster`, `sentiment`, `keyword_extraction`, etc...

If you want to configure each one individually. The next sections will show you how.
