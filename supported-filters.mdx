title: "Supported filters"
---

The supported general filters are: `exists`, `ids`, `numeric`, `date`

## `exists`

![exist.png](/images/exists.png) 

Filtering documents which include the field "brand" in their information.

This filter returns entries in a database if a certain field (as opposed to the field values in previously mentioned filter types) exists or doesn't exist in them.

For instance, filtering out documents in which there is no field 'purchase-info'. 

Python (SDK)

`filters = [
    {
        "field": "brand",
        "filter_type": "exists",
        "condition": "==",
        "condition_value": " "
    }
]

filtered_data = ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
`

## `ids`

![id.png](/images/id.png) 

Filtering documents based on their id.

This filter returns documents whose unique id exists in a given list. It may look similar to 'categories'. The main difference is the speed.

Python

`filters = [
    {
        "field": "_id",
        "filter_type": "ids",
        "condition": "==",
        "condition_value": "7790e058cbe1b1e10e20cd22a1e53d36"
    }
]

filtered_data = ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
`

## `numeric`

![Numeric.png](/images/numeric.png) 

Filtering documents with retail price higher than 5000.

This filter is to perform the filtering operators on a numeric value. 

For instance, returning the documents with a price larger than 1000 dollars.

Python

`filters = [
    {
        "field": "retail_price",
        "filter_type": "numeric",
        "condition": ">",
        "condition_value": "5000"
    }
]
filtered_data = ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
`

## `date`

![date.png](/images/date.png) 

Filtering documents which were added to the database after January 2021.

This filter performs date analysis and filters documents based on their date information. 

For instance, it is possible to filter out any documents with a production date before January 2021.

Python

`filters = [
    {
        "field": "insert_date_",
        "filter_type": "date",
        "condition": "==",
        "condition_value": "2020-07-13"
    }
]

filtered_data = ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
`

Note that the default format is "yyyy-mm-dd" but can be changed to "yyyy-dd-mm" through the `format` parameter as shown in the example below.

Python

`filters = [
    {
        "field": "insert_date_",
        "filter_type": "date",
        "condition": "==",
        "condition_value": "2020-13-07",
        "format": ""yyyy-dd-MM""
    }
]
filtered_data = ds.get_documents(filters=filters)
`
